This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when passing an array to a function expecting a string. The `bug.ts` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version with explanations.  The error arises from a mismatch between the expected function parameter type and the type of the provided argument. The solution highlights techniques to handle such errors, promoting type safety in TypeScript applications.
